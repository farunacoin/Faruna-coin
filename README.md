# Faruna-coin
Faruna Coin is a digital asset that grows in value by the number of reserve and can be spendable and exchanged for cash. Faruna coin has a great future were members or non-members can buy cheaper data and pay bills such as NEPA bills, Gotv, Dstv and StarTime subscriptions.
We truly believe in the "tokenization" of the economy, that is why we created a token to use our service.
Once the reserve grows to one million dollars($1,000,000), then Faruna coin becomes spendable generally by the public.
